=== The directory names used in this project were humorously named in the same [https://half-life.fandom.com/wiki/1500_Megawatt_Aperture_Science_Heavy_Duty_Super-Colliding_Super_Button over-complicated style that Aperture Science uses for their products]. As such, it can understandably be confusing to decipher what each directory's purpose actually is. ===

=== '''Below is a master guide to the directories and their contents:''' ===

*Aperture Science Acoustic Joviation Device
*:Radio Assets
*Aperture Science Directional Assistance Navigational Overlay Correspondant
*:Custom Crosshair Assets
*Aperture Science Eccentric Contraction Coordinates
*:RTM Assets
*Aperture Science Long Band Frequency Air Disturbance Generator Container

*Celebratory Mendacious Moist Consolidated Sustenance
*:Cake Assets
*Esteemed Confidant Euclidean Trigonal Trapezohedron
*:Cube Assets (including Edgeless Safety Cube)
*Obtuse Attitude Adjustment Vegetable Return
*:Combustible Lemon Assets

=== The rest of the directory names should be straightforward in their purpose. Be sure to read the [[Code Guide]] if the SQF files are what you're after. ===
