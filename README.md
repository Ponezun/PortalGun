# **Ready to think with portals in ArmA 3?**
Congratulations! You are now (able to be) in possession of the Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. With it, you can create your own portals. These intra-dimensional gates have proven to be completely safe. The Device, however, has not:
- Do not touch the operational end of The Device.
- Do not look directly at the operational end of The Device.
- Do not submerge The Device in liquid, even partially.
- Most importantly, under no circumstances should you **[REDACTED]**

## **Features:**
- **A 1:1 scale, 2K-textured fully functional and animated portal gun**
- **Fully functional portals\*** that can transport units, vehicles, PhysX objects, and projectiles\*\*, as well as completely conserving the momentum of anything that passes through them
- **Portal gun grabber arms** that you can use to pick up and move PhysX objects
- A **combustible lemon grenade** that can burn your house down
- A version of the portal gun with a **talking potato that will respond to certain events**
- Various **PhysX-compatible objects from the portal series** such as the companion cube and radio which can be placed from 3DEN or Zeus under `Props > Things > Portal`. (These can be picked up with the grabber arms!)
- **Optional updating custom portal crosshair** (with adjustable size)
- **Full multiplayer compatibility**
- Easily and heavily **customizable** via the CBA Addon Options menu
- Full localization for **over 10 languages** (see end of file for details)
- Fully **open source** with documentation, licensed under Apache 2.0
- A cake-based IED that may or may not exist

**\*NOTE:** Portals utilize teleportation rather than being actual "holes" in the geometry. This is due to the limitations of ArmA's engine. If BI ever makes actual holes possible, we will add them.

**\*\*NOTE:** Aiming projectiles through portals can be difficult due to the distortion caused by ArmA's camera system. This is unavoidable due to the above point, so there's nothing we can do about this.
